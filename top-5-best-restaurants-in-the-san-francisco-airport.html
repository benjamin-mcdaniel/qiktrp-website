From fast casual to sit-down dining, there’s something for everyone at SFO. And with so many options, it can be hard to decide where to eat. That’s why we’ve put together a list of the five best restaurants in the airport, so you can make the most of your layover – or extend your vacation just a little bit longer.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#1- Plant Café</h2><p>The Plant Café Organic is one of the newer additions to SFO, but it’s already become a favorite among travelers. The café offers a seasonal menu of organic, locally-sourced dishes, as well as grab-and-go options for those in a hurry. There are also plenty of vegan and vegetarian options, so everyone can find something to enjoy. And with beautiful views of the tarmac, it’s the perfect place to watch the planes come and go.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#2- Napa Farms</h2><p>Napa Farms Market is another great option for those looking for healthy, locally-sourced food. The market features a rotating selection of seasonal dishes from some of Napa Valley’s finest chefs. There’s also a coffee bar and bakery, so you can get your caffeine fix before boarding your flight.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#3- Cat Cora’s</h2><p>If you’re in the mood for some Greek food, look no further than Cat Cora’s Kitchen. The restaurant is helmed by famed chef Cat Cora, and offers classic Greek dishes with a modern twist. There’s also an extensive wine list, so you can pair your meal with the perfect glass of vino.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#4- Yankee Pier</h2><p>Yankee Pier is the perfect spot if you’re craving some seafood. The restaurant serves up fresh seafood from all over the world, including Dungeness crab from right here in San Francisco. And if you’re looking for something a little lighter, they have an excellent selection of salads too.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#5- Andalé Spanish Tapas</h2><p>Last but not least is Andalé Spanish Tapas Restaurant &amp; Bar. This is the place to go if you’re looking for a little taste of Spain in the middle of the airport. The menu features classic tapas like patatas bravas and gambas al ajillo, as well as heartier entrees like paella and chicken Madrid. And don’t forget to order a glass of sangria – it’s some of the best in town!</p><p>San Francisco International Airport is home to some amazing restaurants that will tantalize your taste buds and make your layover feel like a vacation in itself.
