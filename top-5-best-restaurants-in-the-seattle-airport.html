In addition to the usual fast food options, there are plenty of places inside the airport where you can get a real sit-down meal. Here are five of the best places to eat at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#1- Ivar’s</h2><p>Ivar’s Seafood Bar has been a staple at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport since 1994, and it’s easy to see why. This seafood restaurant offers everything from clam chowder and fish tacos to Dungeness crab sandwiches and grilled salmon salads. And if you’re in the mood for something non-seafood, they’ve got you covered there too with burgers, sandwiches, and even vegetarian options.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#2- Anthony’s</h2><p>Anthony’s Restaurant is another great option for a sit-down meal at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. This Pacific Northwest favorite has been serving up fresh seafood since 1969, and their airport location is no different. They’ve got all of your seafood classics like clam chowder, fish &amp; chips, and oysters on the half shell. And if you’re in the mood for something non-seafood, they’ve got plenty of that too including steak, chicken, pasta, and salads.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#3- The Cracked Pepper</h2><p>The Cracked Pepper Bistro is a great option if you’re looking for something a little more upscale. This bistro serves up modern American cuisine with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients. They’ve got everything from chicken pot pie and roasted beet salad to seared scallops and filet mignon. And if you’re in the mood for something lighter, they’ve got a great selection of soups, salads, and sandwiches as well.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#4- Ugly Mug Café</h2><p>Ugly Mug Café is a great option if you’re looking for a quick bite before your flight. This cafe specializes in coffee and pastries, but they also have a selection of sandwiches, salads, and soups if you’re looking for something more substantial. And if you need help getting through security with your coffee mug or food container, they offer complimentary bagging services as well.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">#5- Paseo’s</h2><p>Paseo Caribbean Kitchen is a great choice if you’re in the mood for some Caribbean flavor. This restaurant serves up classic Caribbean dishes like jerk chicken sandwiches and plantain fries as well as more unique items like curried goat tacos and coconut shrimp salad. And if you need help getting through security with your food container, they offer complimentary bagging services as well.</p><p>Whether you’re in the mood for seafood, steak, or something in between, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has plenty of great places to eat.
