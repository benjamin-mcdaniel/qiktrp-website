Considered by many academics as the birthplace of the Renaissance, it is home to breathtaking churches, museums, palaces, and iconic masterpieces, including Michelangelo’s David, Ponte Vecchio, and Brunelleschi’s Dome, among many others. </p><p>If you are planning to visit this beautiful city, we hope this Florence travel guide will help you plan your trip. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Florence, Italy weather</h4><p>In general, the people of Florence experience hot summers with light or moderate rainfall and damp, cool winters. The most ideal time to visit Florence, Italy is between June and October if you wish to participate in summer festivals themed around music, art, and dance. However, if you prefer watching iris bloom and exploring popular Renaissance gardens, we recommend visiting Florence around April to May. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Exchange currency in Florence, Italy</h4><p>Like many other countries in Europe, the currency in Florence is the Euro. It is important to note that many establishments in Florence do not accept travelers cheques, US dollars, and even American Express Euro Cheques. If you happen to find a bank that agrees to cash them, the average conversion rate is 2-4% which is certainly no bargain. Your best option is using local ATMs to obtain Euro and seek information from your local bank to know expected exchange rate and usage fees. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-360"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-min-1024x654.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-min-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-min-300x192.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-min-768x491.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-min-1536x981.jpg 1536w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-min-2048x1309.jpg 2048w" alt="euro" width="1024" height="654" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Florence travel restrictions</h4><p>Because of many different factors, including the pandemic and other Covid restrictions, Florence, Italy’s airport travel restrictions are being updated constantly. To keep informed about any changes in Florence travel restrictions, the Italian Ministry of Health has a dedicated website that contains all the information you need. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Culture in Florence</h4><p>As a foreigner, you have to be aware of the cultures and traditions in Florence, Italy to prevent misunderstandings and remain respectful when interacting with the locals.</p><h5 class="wp-block-heading">Do’s</h5><ol><li>Do be conscious of your clothing choices. Many Italians tend to judge other people based on their clothing choices and they can usually tell if you are a foreigner based on how you dress and present yourself. </li><li>Do cover your shoulders and knees. To enter churches like the Cathedral of Santa Maria Del Fiore, you have to dress modestly, which includes covering your knees and shoulders. </li><li>Do look after your belongings. Like many other big cities, it is very important to keep your belongings secure to protect yourself from pickpockets. </li></ol><h5 class="wp-block-heading">Don’ts</h5><ol><li>Don’t cut up your spaghetti. The most appropriate and respectful way to eat spaghetti at a restaurant is wrapping it around your fork. </li><li>Don’t order a cup of cappuccino after 11 o’clock in the morning. Italians only drink cappuccino in the morning. What you can order instead is a cup of macchiato freddo or caffe macchiato after lunch or dinner. </li><li>Do not wave your hands to hail a cab. The proper way to hail a cab in Florence is to call the radio cab number or go to a cab stand marked by an orange sign.</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Organize Florence, Italy travel documents</h4><p>Make sure you have all the necessary travel documents organized and digital copies secured so you can have a smooth, seamless travel experience.</p><p>People from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Canada, Taiwan, Australia, and more can travel to Florence, Italy without a visa, as long as the whole visit is within a period of up to 90 days.

If you have travel health insurance, the rescue, medications, costs of treatment, and recovery costs will be paid for by your insurance company<em>. </em>Although Florence does not legally require tourists to have health insurance, we strongly recommend getting one to protect yourself from unexpected expenses.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Money and credit/debit card</h4><p>In Florence, you do not have to pay in cash all the time as restaurants, hotels, and shops are well-equipped to handle credit and debit card payments. However, we recommend having at least 50-100 Euros per individual so you can avoid potential worries and rushing in order to locate the nearest ATM. Some of the most popular ATMs in Florence include Chianti Banca ATM, Banca D’Italia ATM, Deutsche Bank ATM, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank ATM, Banca Cambiano ATM, Credit Suisse ATM, and more. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Florence, Italy Itinerary</h4><p>If you are not sure how many days you need to enjoy your Florence trip, we would say three nights is the minimum.
