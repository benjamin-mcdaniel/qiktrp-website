Whether jumping on a flight or hitting the road, your skin is susceptible to dryness, irritation, or flare-ups, especially if you are headed to a different climate. In this article, we talk about the top beauty essentials to bring to avoid such from happening. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Reef-safe sunscreen</h4><p>If you are planning to snorkel on your tropical holiday, then make sure you carry reef-safe sunscreen with you. The most ocean-damaging chemicals include octinoxate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone so check the product label carefully for these major offenders. Generally, you will want to search for a “mineral sunscreen” because this type of sunscreen contains active ingredients like Zinc and Titanium Dioxide.</p><p>There are many eco-conscious sunscreen brands available that provide proper skin protection. Check out the <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/style/beauty/reef-safe-sunscreen" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Best Reef-friendly Sunscreens">Best Reef-friendly Sunscreens</a> of the year. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-318"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-1024x683.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" alt="woman putting on sunscreen" width="1024" height="683" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Dry Shampoo</h4><p>If you do not have the desire or time to wash your hair while on the go, then make sure to purchase a travel-sized dry shampoo. This product will help keep your hair from getting too oily. It removes dirt, sweat, and product buildup and instantly refreshes your hair strands. It can also eliminate unpleasant odors and promote a cleaner look. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Poo~Pourri Toilet Sprays</h4><p>Traveling from one place to another, you will likely share a comfort room with someone else. If you are the kind of tourist, who likes to keep things private, be sure to pick up some Poo~Pourri toilet spray. This product eliminates bathroom odor before it even begins. Just a few drops are enough to remove the funk. Check out their website to learn more. https://pourri.com/</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Skincare Kit</h4><p>Carrying your favorite skincare products with you is not an option. It’s a requirement. There are a few tips you’ll want to keep in mind for your skincare travel kit:</p><p>1 Pack smaller products. Airports typically do not allow taking liquids over 100 mL on an international flight.</p><p>2 Go for familiar skincare ingredients. It would be best to allocate most of your trip to experiencing new things and not struggling with unfamiliar, complicated skincare routines.</p><p>3 Solids over liquids. Solid products can be more convenient when traveling. Make sure to bring solid/powdered dry shampoo and not the liquid variety to avoid spilling and getting the product all over your luggage. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-317"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-1024x678.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-768x509.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2048x1356.jpg 2048w" alt="skincare kit" width="1024" height="678" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Toothpaste Tabs </h4><p>Toothpaste tablets are a plastic-free and more portable oral health solution.

The product offers many health benefits and is an excellent addition to your oral care routine. </p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 3, 2023</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://qiktrp.com/authors/the-author/" class="invert" title="The Author">The Author</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://qiktrp.com/the-top-5-things-to-avoid-in-the-maldives.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">The Top 5 Things To Avoid In The Maldives</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://qiktrp.com/what-are-the-most-helpful-road-trip-advice.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">What Are The Most Helpful Road Trip Advice </h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div><div class="post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Related posts</h2><div class="l-grid l-grid--4"><article class="c-card"><a href="https://qiktrp.com/what-are-the-most-helpful-road-trip-advice.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/media/posts/8/C-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/media/posts/8/responsive/C-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/media/posts/8/responsive/C-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://qiktrp.com/media/posts/8/responsive/C-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/media/posts/8/responsive/C-scaled-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 56.25em) 100vw, (min-width: 37.5em) 50vw, 100vw" loading="lazy" height="1707" width="2560" alt=""></a><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://qiktrp.com/what-are-the-most-helpful-road-trip-advice.html" class="invert">What Are The Most Helpful Road Trip Advice </a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-03T23:53">June 3, 2023</time></footer></div></article></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
