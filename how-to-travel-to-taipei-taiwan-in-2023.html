Whether you wish to see unique artifacts, immerse yourself in a rich culture, or take in a stunning view, Taipei, Taiwan has a lot to offer.</p><p>If you are planning to visit this beautiful city, we hope this Taipei travel guide will help you plan your trip. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Taipei, Taiwan weather</h4><p>In general, the people of Taipei experience mild weather year-round, where the average temperature is about 73°F or 23°C. However, Taipei’s rainy season runs from May to September, where June to August has the most abundant precipitation. To get the whole Taipei experience, avoid these months as much as possible. You can shoot for late October to March so that the weather is dry and cool.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Exchange currency in Taipei, Taiwan</h4><p>The currency in Taipei is New Taiwan Dollar (NTD or TWD). The best place to exchange money in Taipei is at big local banks like South China Commercial Bank, China Trust Bank, or Bank of Taiwan. You can also exchange currency at currency exchange counters at Taipei airports, big shopping malls, and hotels. Simply search on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Bank+of+Taiwan/@25.0404736,121.5084059,15z" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Maps</a> to find local banks, hotels, and malls near you.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Taipei, Taiwan travel restrictions</h4><p>Because of many factors, including the pandemic and other Covid restrictions, Taipei, Taiwan’s airport travel restrictions are constantly being updated. To keep informed about any changes in Taipei travel restrictions, <a href="https://www.trip.com/hot/articles/travel-to-taiwan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trip.com</a> and<a href="http://booking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Booking.com</a> have all the information you need. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Culture in Taipei</h4><p>As a foreigner, it is very important to be aware of the cultures and traditions in Taipei, Taiwan, to prevent misunderstanding and remain respectful when interacting with the locals.</p><h5 class="wp-block-heading">Do’s</h5><ul><li>Do take off your shoes every time you enter someone’s home.</li><li>Do finish your food because wasting food is considered disrespectful.</li><li>Do remember that the dark blue seats in Taipei MRT are only for pregnant women, the elderly, and others in need.</li><li>Do pick up a few Chinese phrases</li><li>Do present money, a gift, or a document using both hands</li></ul><h5 class="wp-block-heading">Don’ts</h5><ul><li>Don’t chew gum, eat, or drink water while you’re inside the MRT.</li><li>Don’t open up the issue about China-Taiwan politics unless you know your friend well.</li><li>Don’t tip, whether it is in hotels, taxis, or restaurants. However, tips are welcomed in bars.</li><li>Do not talk about ‘death’.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Organize Taipei, Taiwan travel documents.</h4><p>Make sure you have organized all the essential travel documents and digital copies secured to have a smooth, seamless travel experience.</p><p>Depending on the type of passport you have, you may need to apply for a visa and secure other important documents to enter Taipei. If you are from the U.S., you need to present a valid passport, confirm your return, and you will be allowed to enter the country without a visa for up to 90 days if your passport allows. If not, you can still enter without a visa for a time equal to your passport’s expiration date.</p><p>To get the most current information, please contact the <a href="https://www.boca.gov.tw/mp-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bureau of Consular Affairs</a>.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Travel health insurance in Taiwan</h4><p>Any travel activity can potentially cause injuries, sprain, and other unexpected accidents. If you have travel health insurance, the rescue, medications, costs of treatment, and recovery costs will be rightfully covered by your insurance company. Although Taiwan does not legally require tourists to have health insurance, we strongly recommend getting one to protect yourself from unexpected expenses.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Money and credit/debit card</h4><p>It should not be difficult to find ATMs in Taipei. Almost all banks have a separate ATM area open 24/7 and many 7/11 stores and department stores have them as well. Some of the most popular ATMs in Taipei include HSBC ATM, Citibank ATM, Taipei Fubon Bank ATM, to name a few. While some establishments only accept Taiwanese cards, foreign debit, and credit cards can still be used in many ATMs but will incur charges.
