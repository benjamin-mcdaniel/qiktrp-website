The country has stunning islands, soft-sand beaches, and clear turquoise waters. Its excellent snorkeling opportunities, picture-perfect sunsets, and tropical temperatures are the perfect way to escape from the standard 9-to-5 workweek. Still, there are things to keep in mind during a trip to the Maldives. Here are the top 5 mistakes to avoid when exploring this tropical paradise. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid public displays of affection</h4><p>The Maldives is a conservative island country and displaying attention in public can draw in uncomfortable frowns and unpleasant stares from locals who are not used to seeing such behavior. This includes a peck on the cheek, hand-holding, and kissing. If caught, the behavior may result in punitive action. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-312"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-1024x682.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1.jpg 2000w" alt="a man and a woman holding hands" width="1024" height="682" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do not wear a bikini</h4><p>As a Muslim country, the Maldives government advises women to avoid wearing bikinis or revealing clothes in public. Doing so is deemed disrespectful and is considered a violation. Even if you disagree with such customs, it is better to obey than face any unpleasant consequences. </p><p>Fortunately, resort islands tend not to have such rules, and you’re free to show off your newly bought bathing suit and relax under the sun. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Be careful in drinking tap water</h4><p>This is one the most important fact to remember during your trip to the Maldives. In this island country, water undergoes reverse osmosis desalination to eliminate harmful germs and bacteria. Although this method helps eradicate bacteria and germs from recycled water, it also strips the H2O of any vitamins and minerals, which means that the water contains no rehydrating properties. </p><p>If you are planning to drink alcohol or stay under the sun for an extended period, opt for bottled water instead. You may also bring electrolyte powders or pills to ensure you are rehydrated anytime, anywhere. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-313"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1024x597.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-300x175.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-768x448.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1536x896.jpg 1536w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-2048x1195.jpg 2048w" alt="a child washing their hands" width="1024" height="597" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do not choose a resort without many activities</h4><p>Different resorts offer different types of activities. If you are searching for a more active travel experience that includes scuba diving, fishing, snorkeling, or dancing the night away, check out all the activities offered at the resort you chose before booking. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do not settle for the cheapest resort</h4><p>Sure, you may have seen photos of gorgeous white-sand beaches and overwater bungalows in the Maldives, but not every resort in the country looks as exquisite. You can avail of numerous budget options, but you will need to manage your expectations. Sometimes you have to spend more to nab superb accommodations. </p><p>Why spend hundreds and thousands on a flight only to be stuck in a resort with terrible food options, not-so-exciting activities, and a musty room? That is why it is imperative to know what you are getting before you arrive at your destination. Ensure the resort is legitimate, pristine, and has good reviews. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-314"><img src="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-1024x683.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://qiktrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" alt="small rest house by the beach" width="1024" height="683" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></figure></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 3, 2023</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h6 bio__name"><a href="https://qiktrp.com/authors/the-author/" class="invert" title="The Author">The Author</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://qiktrp.com/what-are-the-best-music-festivals-to-attend.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">What Are The Best Music Festivals To Attend</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://qiktrp.com/the-most-helpful-beauty-products-to-bring-while-travelling.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">The Most Helpful Beauty Products To Bring While Travelling</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
