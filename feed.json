            "content_html": "<p>Florence, Italy is a major cultural, economic, political, and financial center in Europe. Considered by many academics as the birthplace of the Renaissance, it is home to breathtaking churches, museums, palaces, and iconic masterpieces, including Michelangelo’s David, Ponte Vecchio, and Brunelleschi’s Dome, among many others. </p>\n<p>If you are planning to visit this beautiful city, we hope this Florence travel guide will help you plan your trip. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Florence, Italy weather</h4>\n<p>In general, the people of Florence experience hot summers with light or moderate rainfall and damp, cool winters. The most ideal time to visit Florence, Italy is between June and October if you wish to participate in summer festivals themed around music, art, and dance. However, if you prefer watching iris bloom and exploring popular Renaissance gardens, we recommend visiting Florence around April to May. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exchange currency in Florence, Italy</h4>\n<p>Like many other countries in Europe, the currency in Florence is the Euro. It is important to note that many establishments in Florence do not accept travelers cheques, US dollars, and even American Express Euro Cheques. If you happen to find a bank that agrees to cash them, the average conversion rate is 2-4% which is certainly no bargain. Your best option is using local ATMs to obtain Euro and seek information from your local bank to know expected exchange rate and usage fees. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Florence travel restrictions</h4>\n<p>Because of many different factors, including the pandemic and other Covid restrictions, Florence, Italy’s airport travel restrictions are being updated constantly. To keep informed about any changes in Florence travel restrictions, the Italian Ministry of Health has a dedicated website that contains all the information you need. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Culture in Florence</h4>\n<p>As a foreigner, you have to be aware of the cultures and traditions in Florence, Italy to prevent misunderstandings and remain respectful when interacting with the locals.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do’s</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Do be conscious of your clothing choices. Many Italians tend to judge other people based on their clothing choices and they can usually tell if you are a foreigner based on how you dress and present yourself. </li>\n<li>Do cover your shoulders and knees. To enter churches like the Cathedral of Santa Maria Del Fiore, you have to dress modestly, which includes covering your knees and shoulders. </li>\n<li>Do look after your belongings. Like many other big cities, it is very important to keep your belongings secure to protect yourself from pickpockets. </li>\n</ol>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’ts</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t cut up your spaghetti. The most appropriate and respectful way to eat spaghetti at a restaurant is wrapping it around your fork. </li>\n<li>Don’t order a cup of cappuccino after 11 o’clock in the morning. Italians only drink cappuccino in the morning. What you can order instead is a cup of macchiato freddo or caffe macchiato after lunch or dinner. </li>\n<li>Do not wave your hands to hail a cab. The proper way to hail a cab in Florence is to call the radio cab number or go to a cab stand marked by an orange sign.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Organize Florence, Italy travel documents</h4>\n<p>Make sure you have all the necessary travel documents organized and digital copies secured so you can have a smooth, seamless travel experience.</p>\n<p>People from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Canada, Taiwan, Australia, and more can travel to Florence, Italy without a visa, as long as the whole visit is within a period of up to 90 days.

            "content_html": "<p>Road trips are a completely different kind of travel experience. You can get entirely in tune with the destination, dive deep, discover hidden gems along the way, and immerse in the area instead of just arriving. These top tips for road trips will prepare you long before you lock your front door and help you save money so you can spend more time enjoying the trip and less dealing with pesky complications. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be Smart About Gas Mileage</h4>\n<p>As the prices of gas continue to increase, you may find yourself spending more on gas and having less spending money on the road. To ensure you are saving on gas, one thing you can do is decelerate. For instance, when going from 0-50 mph, slow down your vehicle’s acceleration time to about 15 seconds, and you can save up to 30% (or more!) on gas mileage. You may also keep your windows shut while driving at high speeds to avoid decreasing your gas mileage by up to 10%. </p>\n<p>Removing excess weight, avoiding driving on rough terrain, and ensuring tires are pressurized to their maximum limit are also actions you can make to save money on gas. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make Sure Your Vehicle Is Ready</h4>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Be prepared for anything. The road can be very dangerous for road travelers so you have to create a plan at least a few weeks or months in advance for any possible difficulties and repairs. Check and adjust your car oil, tire pressure, spare tire, coolant, brakes, accessories, and lights if needed. If you are not very knowledgeable about car parts, get your vehicle inspected my auto repair professionals. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make Sure You Are Ready</h4>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You certainly have to be just as ready for the road trip as your vehicle. Tell your close friends and family where you are heading, and make sure to get a good night’s sleep before hitting the road. Check on your cellphone range and make sure you have the number of emergency operators and you can reach them from where you are planning to go. </p>\n<p>It is also a must for road travelers to become familiar with the roadways and the weather forecast. Utilize the top traveling apps to ensure you are properly ready for the road trip. Also, remember to wear a comfortable outfit and pack necessities, including first aid kit, snacks, drinking water, jumper cables, and maps, among many others. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid peak dinner time and rush hour traffic</h4>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sitting in a congested road and waiting for your order can definitely lose a lot of your time. We recommend eating breakfast after 9 am, getting lunch around 2 pm, and ordering dinner either early at 4 pm or waiting until 7 pm. During these timeframes, you will generally get seated faster, and your food will be served relatively quicker. </p>\n<p>When driving between destinations, on the other hand, avoid hitting the road from 7 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 6 pm. Use a mobile navigation app to spot potential traffic jams from construction, accidents, and congestions and find routes for detours. </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>While figuring out what to bring for your long-awaited trip means focusing on shoes, accessories, and clothes, your beauty routine has to be top of mind too. Whether jumping on a flight or hitting the road, your skin is susceptible to dryness, irritation, or flare-ups, especially if you are headed to a different climate. In this article, we talk about the top beauty essentials to bring to avoid such from happening. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reef-safe sunscreen</h4>\n<p>If you are planning to snorkel on your tropical holiday, then make sure you carry reef-safe sunscreen with you. The most ocean-damaging chemicals include octinoxate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone so check the product label carefully for these major offenders. Generally, you will want to search for a “mineral sunscreen” because this type of sunscreen contains active ingredients like Zinc and Titanium Dioxide.</p>\n<p>There are many eco-conscious sunscreen brands available that provide proper skin protection. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/style/beauty/reef-safe-sunscreen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" title=\"Best Reef-friendly Sunscreens\">Best Reef-friendly Sunscreens</a> of the year. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dry Shampoo</h4>\n<p>If you do not have the desire or time to wash your hair while on the go, then make sure to purchase a travel-sized dry shampoo. This product will help keep your hair from getting too oily. It removes dirt, sweat, and product buildup and instantly refreshes your hair strands. It can also eliminate unpleasant odors and promote a cleaner look. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Poo~Pourri Toilet Sprays</h4>\n<p>Traveling from one place to another, you will likely share a comfort room with someone else. If you are the kind of tourist, who likes to keep things private, be sure to pick up some Poo~Pourri toilet spray. This product eliminates bathroom odor before it even begins. Just a few drops are enough to remove the funk. Check out their website to learn more. https://pourri.com/</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Skincare Kit</h4>\n<p>Carrying your favorite skincare products with you is not an option. It’s a requirement. There are a few tips you’ll want to keep in mind for your skincare travel kit:</p>\n<p>1 Pack smaller products. Airports typically do not allow taking liquids over 100 mL on an international flight.</p>\n<p>2 Go for familiar skincare ingredients. It would be best to allocate most of your trip to experiencing new things and not struggling with unfamiliar, complicated skincare routines.</p>\n<p>3 Solids over liquids. Solid products can be more convenient when traveling. Make sure to bring solid/powdered dry shampoo and not the liquid variety to avoid spilling and getting the product all over your luggage. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toothpaste Tabs </h4>\n<p>Toothpaste tablets are a plastic-free and more portable oral health solution. They come in a sustainable, eco-friendly container. When chewed and activated by water, toothy tabs can clean your teeth with cavity-fighting ingredients. The product offers many health benefits and is an excellent addition to your oral care routine. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>For many tourists, the Maldives is a dream vacation spot. The country has stunning islands, soft-sand beaches, and clear turquoise waters. Its excellent snorkeling opportunities, picture-perfect sunsets, and tropical temperatures are the perfect way to escape from the standard 9-to-5 workweek. Still, there are things to keep in mind during a trip to the Maldives. Here are the top 5 mistakes to avoid when exploring this tropical paradise. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid public displays of affection</h4>\n<p>The Maldives is a conservative island country and displaying attention in public can draw in uncomfortable frowns and unpleasant stares from locals who are not used to seeing such behavior. This includes a peck on the cheek, hand-holding, and kissing. If caught, the behavior may result in punitive action. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do not wear a bikini</h4>\n<p>As a Muslim country, the Maldives government advises women to avoid wearing bikinis or revealing clothes in public. Doing so is deemed disrespectful and is considered a violation. Even if you disagree with such customs, it is better to obey than face any unpleasant consequences. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, resort islands tend not to have such rules, and you’re free to show off your newly bought bathing suit and relax under the sun. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be careful in drinking tap water</h4>\n<p>This is one the most important fact to remember during your trip to the Maldives. In this island country, water undergoes reverse osmosis desalination to eliminate harmful germs and bacteria. Although this method helps eradicate bacteria and germs from recycled water, it also strips the H2O of any vitamins and minerals, which means that the water contains no rehydrating properties. </p>\n<p>If you are planning to drink alcohol or stay under the sun for an extended period, opt for bottled water instead. You may also bring electrolyte powders or pills to ensure you are rehydrated anytime, anywhere. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do not choose a resort without many activities</h4>\n<p>Different resorts offer different types of activities. If you are searching for a more active travel experience that includes scuba diving, fishing, snorkeling, or dancing the night away, check out all the activities offered at the resort you chose before booking. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do not settle for the cheapest resort</h4>\n<p>Sure, you may have seen photos of gorgeous white-sand beaches and overwater bungalows in the Maldives, but not every resort in the country looks as exquisite. You can avail of numerous budget options, but you will need to manage your expectations. Sometimes you have to spend more to nab superb accommodations. </p>\n<p>Why spend hundreds and thousands on a flight only to be stuck in a resort with terrible food options, not-so-exciting activities, and a musty room? That is why it is imperative to know what you are getting before you arrive at your destination. Ensure the resort is legitimate, pristine, and has good reviews. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Attending music festivals is a great method to escape from your regular day-to-day routine and recharge your energy and spirit. In this article, we explore the hottest music festivals in the world that we’re certain you’ll enjoy. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</h4>\n<p>Coachella is the most attended, highest-grossing, and hottest music festival on the planet. No other music fest has as much impact on the music industry as this grand music event. Held in a sun-drenched grassy polo complex in Indio, California, Coachella is both a lively celebration of South Californian spirit and a platform for musicians to share a moment with a huge crowd. </p>\n<p>If you are planning to head off to this annual music and festival, make sure to bring your favorite sunscreen spray, sunglasses, hands-free bag, easy-pitching tents, portable chargers, and other essentials to make the most out of the experience. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tomorrowland Music Festival</h4>\n<p>Tomorrowland is a popular music festival held in Boom, Flanders, Belgium. This long-running event is often celebrated as the biggest dance music party in the world. Held on an imaginative space called Tomorrow Holy Grounds, attendees consider Tomorrowland the most imagination-defying and mystical experience a person can have without leaving the planet. The fest includes artists across EDM, techno, trance, drum n bass, and house spread over ten mindblowing stages. </p>\n<p>Built around wild storytelling and mythical imageries, Tomorrowland is a must-experience for dance music fans. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Glastonbury Festival</h4>\n<p>No other music fest has done more to develop, nurture, and celebrate the peculiarities of modern music fest culture quite like the people of Glastonbury. This five-day occasion, known colloquially as Glasto, takes place in Pilton, Somerset, England. It has served as a ground zero for many counter-cultural movements in the 70s and 80s, and is one of the only few music festivals to take “fallow years,” mostly at five-year intervals to give the land a break. </p>\n<p>If you are planning to visit England, don’t miss out on Glasto. The festival has been through various incarnations over the years, but it remains to be an iconic event that promotes tolerance and acceptance among a diverse variety of music. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Electric Daisy Carnival</h4>\n<p>EDC is an annual dance music fest held every summer in different parts of Las Vegas, Orlando, China, Mexico, and other countries across the globe. This event takes over the world every May featuring the ultimate spectacle of lighting, sound, and the most prominent performers in techno, house, drum n bass, and other genres of music. </p>\n<p>If your searching for a unique multi-day music fest that incorporates carnival themes and cutting edge stage production, and sets the standards  in the live entertainment industry, EDC is one of the music festivals you should consider attending. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Whether you want to level up your in-flight experience, pick the best seat on the plane, or simply decide the best time to book a flight, life above 35,000 feet is filled with quandaries. Fortunately, it does not take much to find the answers. All you need is a little insider information to discover top travel secrets to make your flight more fun and smooth-sailing.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Subscribe to an airline’s newsletters</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest traveling expenses is airfare costs, especially if you are taking a trip abroad. If you wish to avoid skimping on your meal budget or your souvenirs, one way to save money is by purchasing discounted airplane tickets. You can easily nab discounts by subscribing to newsletters. Airlines typically offer promos and deals through email. Simply put your name on their lists so you can be updated on the promo codes, vouchers, and other special offers.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be careful not to catch a cold</h4>\n<p>One research study shows that low cabin humidity and close quarters lower immunity and make individuals in the room 113 times more susceptible to autoimmune diseases than on a typical day. So make sure to bring your own water, take vitamin C, keep your nose moisturized, and sanitize your hands when in the air. If you are near a sick passenger, ask the flight attendant if it’s possible to switch seats. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t always book multiple tickets at once</h4>\n<p>If you are planning to purchase multiple tickets, search for them individually. The price of plane tickets varies depending on the travel agency; many times, individual seats are significantly cheaper than a block. Also, if you search for, say, five tickets, and they only have four at the lowest fare, all five are bumped to a more expensive price bracket. If you decide to purchase individual tickets, make sure that there are no per-ticket processing fees that would offset the savings. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See what your airplane looks like before boarding.</h4>\n<p>Don’t blindly select your airplane seat. Before booking a flight, simply type the airline and flight number you’re interested in into sites like SeatGuru, Kayak, SeatMeastro, or other alternatives. By using these website, you can view seat maps, the exact lay out of your plane, and customer reviews of airplane seats. They will let you know which seat has extra legroom, which is the closest to the lavatory, where to find power jacks, and other relevant information.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting unexpected freebies is possible if you ask.</h4>\n<p>While airlines do not bother advertising it, there are certain freebies and above-and-beyond services that you can get if you ask. A mini bottle of drinking water, a full can of soda, or extra snacks can usually be easily acquired from the flight attendants, while small unexpected perks like a band-aid or sanitizing wipes may require a special request but are typically on hand for the flight crew. If the flight is delayed, many airlines also offer free premium drinks or snacks. </p>",
